/**
 * Explicit full garbage collection after large short-lived forecast
 * memory is dropped: the streaming decoder's one-step block and decode
 * buffers at the end of an update, and a route's corridor store when the
 * route ends. An idle isolate (the route worker between jobs) can go
 * hours without a major GC, so that memory would otherwise stay resident
 * until some later collection. (The decoded forecast itself is on disk,
 * never resident; see data/decoded.ts.)
 *
 * `gc` is obtained without a command-line flag: --expose_gc set at run
 * time installs `gc` in contexts created afterwards, so a fresh vm
 * context hands it back. If that is unavailable nothing happens (the old
 * store is then freed whenever V8 next collects on its own).
